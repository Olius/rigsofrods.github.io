<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the blog section now being back alive I though I&#8217;d give it a shot and
write about my personal goals for Rigs of Rods. Every developer working on
an open source project usually has his own vision for what the project could
become and works on things that bring it closer to that vision.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="my_vision_of_rigs_of_rods"><a class="anchor" href="#my_vision_of_rigs_of_rods"></a>My vision of Rigs of Rods</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I would like to see RoR going much faster than it currently does. RoR is
usually limited by the CPU as it has to do a lot of floating point math to
simulate the behaviour of beams and nodes. Other limiting factors probably
are memory latency and bandwidth since structures for beams and nodes are
quite large in size and there are hundreds of them per vehicle. Besides the
fact that the whole phsyics core could use a cleanup it is also required
that we increase accuracy (discussion:
<a href="http://www.rigsofrods.com/threads/118051-Discussion-Moving-to-double-precision-for-physics">Discussion-Moving-to-double-precision-for-physics</a>)
to improve the quality of the simulation. When we do that a major overhaul
of the physics core is needed which would be a great chance to improve
performance as well. I believe that there is more room for parallelization
and that we should use it whenever possible. In the best case RoR should be
able to max out any number of CPU cores while still running significantly
faster on a single core than it does now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Besides a speedup in performance I would also like to see the physics
calculations being moved to the server. The details are unclear yet because
it would suddenly increase server hardware requirements a lot. Maybe we will
have an option to toggle serverside physics on and off.  The major benefit
of serverside physics calculation is that multiplayer collisions are
possible, something that many have asked for and I want to see happening
myself. It would also lead to a clear separation between client and server,
potentially putting less stress on the client than before. We will have to
see how much that could be since some calculations will probably still be
needed clientside for movement predicition to reduce perceived lag. It would
certainly seperate rendering and physics though, already increasing
performance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I got access to an 80-core cluster computer. My ultimate goal is that the
RoR server (with physics calculations being serverside) is able to take
advantage of such a system. I would like to see it being able to make use of
all cluster nodes using OpenMPI to spread physics calculations across all
cores so we can potentially have many people spawning many vehicles in one
multiplayer session. In case this becomes possible I may host a community
event, hosting a RoR server on said cluster for an evening to have a big
wreck fest. It&#8217;s still uncertain if this is possible at all. The possible
degree of parallelization for the physics core has yet to be
determined. When working with clusters additional problems arise like
latency and bandwidth for communication between nodes. The latency could be
large enough to make this whole project fail but since a similar project
probably has never been done before we can&#8217;t know for certain until we
tried.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">So, to summarize</dt>
<dd>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>large performance increase</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ability to make use of any number of CPU cores, if possible</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>serverside physics calculations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OpenMPI support for use on clusters</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keep in mind though that this is just a vision of mine yet. Work hasn&#8217;t even
started and it will probably take a while until it does since we would like
to provide a solid new stable build first. Some of these things may not even
possible or won&#8217;t ever come to life. We&#8217;ll have to see what the future
holds.</p>
