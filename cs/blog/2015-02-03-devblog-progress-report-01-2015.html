<p>Hello all RoR fans!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My name is <strong>Petr Ohlidal</strong> (a.k.a <strong>only_a_ptr</strong>) and I would like to give you
an update on Rigs of Rods development in the past month. I will also sum up
all activity which has been going on since I joined the project - and there
is a lot to sum up, RoR has changed significantly since then.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I joined the project in fall 2013. At the time, RoR was a dying project: the
original authors left to develop a commercial <strong>BeamNG</strong> project and community
had been inactive for more than 6 months or so. The last stable release was
<em>2 years old</em> and the new version was half-baked. I evaluated the state of
the project, decided my priorities and started coding. For the first months,
my effort had no visible outcome as I decided to rewrite some very internal
logic, but finally I released several test builds and today, they&#8217;re
consolidated into a single development version which aspires for a new
stable release.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To my great cheer, my enthusiasm has sparkled a new wave of collaborative
development, and today, RoR has <strong>4 active developers</strong>:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Me</strong> - Self-invited lead coder, a code greasemonkey focused on internals and software architecture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Max98</strong> - Cheerful enthusiast with focus on GUI and graphics. Fixed some long standing graphic bugs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hiradur</strong> - Valuable compiler specialist and analyst. Keeps RoR running on Linux and inspects it with Valgrind for memory issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Aperion</strong> - Old community member and contributor who came back to help.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the moment, the development is aimed towards delivering a new stable
release. This is very important to shake off the "dead project" feeling. RoR
has not had a stable release in years and with new similarily-themed
projects, BeamNG and SpinTires, it seemed that RoR will become history. That
is, however, not going to happen. Not only RoR lives on, but it also stays
unique among all competition. The planned release is dubbed NextStable and
has a version number 0.4.5, which displays the significant leap from last
available build 0.4.0.7. This leap is well deserved, RoR has undergone a
significant facelift and got rid of some long standing bugs which annoyed
and discouraged players for too long. Also, major refactoring was done on
the inside, to serve as groundwork for future enhancements and
stability. This is a list of the most important achievements:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>RoR got main menu! Until now, RoR worked in a straightforward scenario
"start - select track - select vehicle - play - exit game", which wasn&#8217;t
really player-friendly. Also, the internal startup logic was
over-complicated and slow, so it received a lot of fixes. Courtesy of Max98.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RoR got new GUI skin. The previous "orange with bright orange" was really
lame. New one comes in orange+black and really feels like a vehicle-driving
game. Kudos to Max98.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RoR got in-game configuration panels. Previously, all the configuration had
to be done in external configurator, which works, but it&#8217;s not very
appealing to players. Thanks goes to Max98.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RoR got a built-in editor for vehicles. Until now, modding had to be done
with variety of external tools and a lot of hand-writing. However, this
approach will soon be history. The editor is not fully featured yet, but
it&#8217;s architecture allows it to fully load/save the vehicle format and
perform any modifications, with mouse and hotkeys, in an interactive
environment. A primary inspiration for controls and workflow is Blender.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rig definition file format (.truck) was completely re-coded. The old logic
was flawed, bloated and effectively blocked any future enhancements. The new
one is a separate component designed for stability and extensibility. It
also allowed creating the rig editor. However, a lot of content stopped
working in the process, sometimes due to bugs in new code, but often because
of syntax flaws or inconsistencies and bad practices in .truck files
themselves. Work is being done to fix the situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Max98 fixed two inflamous graphics bugs - shadows and skidmarks. He&#8217;s also
putting a lot of attention into sky, water and environment in general.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Following is a list of things to definitely expect in NextStable:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>It will provide a list of errors and warnings every time a vehicle
spawned. This is mainly to help modders, but also to inform players of
possible incompatibility of older content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It will support most of the vehicles which are currently broken. Sadly, some
of them will not be compatible due to legacy flaws or bad practices of mod
authors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not much else to change. This is actually a good feature, because more
changes would mean more waiting and I know everyone is already tired of
waiting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Actually, if you feel like NextStable is coming out pretty slowly, it&#8217;s not
just you. I&#8217;ve been putting off the work for a long time because, honestly,
bugfixing is boring and there is a lot of juicy redesign waiting to be done
in the simulation code. So, instead of delivering what everybody is waiting
for, I&#8217;ve been fiddling with the internals in my private development
branches. Sorry guys. However, no more slacking off, I&#8217;ve published my
experiments in my GitHub forks, consolidated my changes and I&#8217;m back to
bugfixing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From now on, I&#8217;ll be publishing a progress report blog post every
month. This idea came from Max98, big thanks to him, a dev blog is a big
step forward in presenting the project. Expect future posts to be a lot more
detailed and to the point, this post is somewhat bland because it just has
too much to sum up.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cheers</p>
