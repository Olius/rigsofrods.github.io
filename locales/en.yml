      title: "Dive into soft body physics"
      content:
        about: "Rigs of Rods is a sandbox-style vehicle simulator."
        different: "What makes Rigs of Rods different to most simulators is its unique soft-body physics model: vehicles, machines, objects, etc. are simulated in real-time as flexible soft-body objects, giving the simulation an extremely accurate behavior which entirely depends on the physical construction of the vehicles or objects you create."
